    "As of 3-3-20, the capstone project is progressing well. All of the data is in hand and has been through cleaning and EDA. I haven't yet begun modeling, but do not foresee any major stumbling blocks. The one major issue I currently face is the complexity of the region library I intend to use to generate geographically contiguous clusters. At minimum, I'll be able to create some linear regression models and non-contiguous clusters on my current data. I'd like to explore some different models and especially get the contiguous clusters working, and ideally I'd love to add more county-level data to my current pool, which should be fairly easy with so much FIPS-coded data available through data.gov - if, that is, I have time."
